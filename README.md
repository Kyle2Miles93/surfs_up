## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to figure out whether the location in Oahu, picked for the ice cream stand / surfing shop,
was appropriate for a business. I did this by analyzing a weather file and a sqlite database for weather. I analyzed
the months of June and December, so summer and winter are covered.

## Results

Here is a snapshot of the summary statistics for June:

Based on these statistics, I found:

* The summers are extremeley temperate in this particluar location in Oahu.
 
  1) The average temperature for June was 77.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
  2) The high was a mere 83 degrees F.

* The winters, starting in December are **ALSO** *extremely* temperate.

  1) The minimum temperature was only 60 degrees F
  2) The average temperature for December was only 6 degrees cooler than in June: 71 degrees F!
 
Here is a picture of December's statistics:

## Summary

In conclusion:

* This location is extremely temperate, and would be ideal for an ice cream business.

* It would be more than ideal for surfing too, and would not require customers to buy a wetsuit.

* One would be persuaded to expand the business to provide more services for tourists and locals.

Additional queries that one could make:

1) We could gather info on windiness for this particular location.
2) We could find out if this location has many shark attacks, though that would require 
more than weather data.
3) We could query for info on humidity.
4) Cloudiness will also be an important factor to investigate.
